DOCKER INSTALLATION:
	=>sudo apt-get update
	=>sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io
					or 
	=>sudo apt-get install docker.io
	=>sudo apt install docker.io

START AND ENABLE THE DOCKER SERVICE:
	=>sudo systemctl start docker
	=>sudo systemctl enable docker

DOCKERFILE CREATION FORMAT:
*We need create file without any extension with below commands.
	FROM python:3.7
	CMD python -m pip install --upgrade pip
	RUN pip install joblib
	RUN pip install numpy
	RUN pip install scipy 
	RUN pip install scikit-learn
	RUN pip install tensorflow
	RUN pip install matplotlib
	RUN pip install pillow
	RUN pip install imutils
	RUN pip install opencv-python
	RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-opencv
	RUN pip install opencv-python
	WORKDIR /fr-docker
	COPY . ./fr-docker
	CMD ['python3', './fr-docker/data/script/generate_data.py']


HOW TO BUILD AN IMAGE:
	=>docker build -t <tag_name> -f <Dockerfile> .

HOW TO RUN THE PYTHON FILE IN DOCKER IMAGE:
	=>xhost local:docker 
	=>sudo docker run -it --rm --env="DISPLAY" --volume="/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw" --device="/dev/video0:/dev/video0" fr-docker python ./fr-docker/live_recognition.py

HOW TO SAVE AND LOAD DOCKER IMAGE IN THE LOCAL MACHINE:
	=>docker save <docker image name> | gzip > <docker image name>.tar.gz
	=>zcat <docker image name>.tar.gz | docker load

HOW TO CREATE DOCKER IMAGE FILE IN THE REMOTE HOST:
	=>docker save <image> | bzip2 | ssh user@host docker load
	=>docker save <image> | bzip2 | pv | ssh user@host docker load - to check how the trasfer is going

                                         (OR)
    =>scp file.txt remote_username@10.10.0.2:/remote/directory - to transfer or copy the files from local to remote server
    =>We need to copy Dockerfile and the python files to the server.
    =>We need to build the docker image in the server by using the Dockerfile.
    =>We can run the docker.

HOW TO RUN CREATED IMAGE IN THE SERVER:
	=>docker run <docker_image_name>
